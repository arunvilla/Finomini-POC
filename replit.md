â”œâ”€â”€ app.json              # Expo configuration
â””â”€â”€ package.json          # Dependencies
```

## Running the Mobile App

### Prerequisites
1. Install Expo Go app on your mobile device:
   - iOS: Download from App Store
   - Android: Download from Google Store

### Development
The mobile app is configured to run on port 8080:
```bash
cd Finomini-Mobile
npm install
RCT_METRO_PORT=8080 npx expo start --port 8080
```

### Testing on Device
1. Run the Expo development server (already configured in workflow)
2. Scan the QR code displayed in the console with:
   - iOS: Camera app
   - Android: Expo Go app
3. The app will load on your device

## Core Screens

### 1. Dashboard
- Net worth overview with assets/liabilities breakdown
- Account balances with icons
- Recent transactions list
- Color-coded positive/negative amounts

### 2. Transactions
- Full transaction history grouped by date
- Income vs Expenses summary
- Transaction details with merchant, category, account
- Add transaction button

### 3. Budgets
- Monthly budget overview
- Category-based budget tracking with progress bars
- Visual indicators for over-budget categories
- Remaining budget calculations

### 4. Goals
- Financial goals with progress tracking
- Deadline countdown
- Target vs current amount visualization
- Quick contribution buttons

## Data Structure
All screens use shared TypeScript types:
- Transaction
- Budget
- Goal
- Account
- NetWorthData

Mock data is defined in `src/data/mockData.ts` and matches the web app's data structure.

## Recent Changes (October 1, 2025)

### TestFlight Empty Screens Fix - Build 10
- **Issue Resolved**: Fixed empty screens appearing in TestFlight builds
- **Critical Fixes Implemented**:
  1. Installed expo-linear-gradient (~15.0.7) - required dependency for chart gradients in production
  2. Added responsive dimensions utility (utils/dimensions.ts) - all charts now use getChartWidth() instead of hardcoded values
  3. Created ChartErrorBoundary component - gracefully handles chart rendering failures with fallback UI
  4. Enhanced data validation in chartDataAdapters.ts:
     - Uses Number.isFinite() instead of falsy checks (allows zero values)
     - Returns safe fallback data instead of empty arrays
     - Prevents invalid/NaN values from reaching charts
  5. Wrapped ALL charts with error boundaries:
     - DashboardScreen: LineChart (net worth trend)
     - NetWorthDetailScreen: 2 LineCharts (trend + assets vs liabilities)
     - BudgetsScreen: PieChart with empty state fallback
  6. Added divide-by-zero guards for progress bar calculations
  7. Incremented iOS buildNumber to 10
- **Production Status**: Ready for TestFlight submission
- **Dependencies**: expo-linear-gradient, react-native-gifted-charts, react-native-svg all verified
